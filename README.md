Please notice that the reference format and the codes are not the final versions, we will continuously update them in the following some days. Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions or comments. My Email address is: xueyu@nuist.edu.cn

I will also update the reference and codes in my ResearchGate website at

(1) File "testingFrameworkOnXue" is the main procedure
(2) The maximum number of fitness evaluation can be modified in the file "\LSFS\algLib\Benchmarks\Xue\getFunParamOnXue.m"
(3) The codes for the proposed method are included in the file of "\LSFS\algLib\algorithms\LSFS"
